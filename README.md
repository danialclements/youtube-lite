This project was created as a code challenge for potential employment at Aphix Software

## Downloading and Running Project
I have altered the default .gitignore to allow the /dist folder to be checked into SCM despite it being against best practices.  This will allow you to run the application locally by launching /dist/index.html

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Launch /dist/index.html
4. Use the app as normal
